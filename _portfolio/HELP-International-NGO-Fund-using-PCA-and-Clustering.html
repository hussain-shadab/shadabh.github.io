 In this project, I categorised the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. 
 Then suggested the countries which the NGO needs to focus on the most.<br>
 I used dimensionality reduction using PCA to get the visualisations of the clusters in a 2-D form.
