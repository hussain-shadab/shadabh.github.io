In this paper, four different interpolation methods, namely Newton-Gregory Forward, Newton- Gregory Backward, Lagrange and Newton divided difference, are used for solving the real life problem. <br>
The estimated result shows that first two interpolation methods (Newton-Gregory Forward and Newton-Gregory Backward) give the same values. Since the range (40-45) is near to the starting point therefore Newton-forward is suitable for this case however Newton backward method is found computationally expensive for this case. The last two methods (Lagrange and Newton divided difference) are generally used for unequal intervals. All four methods gives same results but computational point of view, the last three are more expensive because of the point of interest and equation complexity.
