In this blog, we are going to classify images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and for deployment, you can use Colab, Kaggle or even use your local machine since the dataset size is not very large. 
At the end of this, you will be able to build your own image classifier that detects males and females or anything that is tangible.

Letâ€™s see a bit of theory about deep learning and CNNs.
